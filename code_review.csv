Overall, good workflows.
o. Each part of the workflow seems to be saved in different *.ipynb files. It would have been better to have them all in one integrated workflow.
o. Some of the code cells come with no comment, which makes it a bit difficult to follow.
o. It would have been better to keep the colors of rock facies consistent over different figures. E.g., in ""MICEImputation.ipynb"", Cell [13] and [16] use different color templates for rock facies."

o. Excellent executive summary and workflow steps!
